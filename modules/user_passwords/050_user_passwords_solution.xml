<section><title>solution: users and passwords</title>
	<para>1. Create the users Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Justine Henin, all of them with password set to <command>hunter2</command>, with their first name in lower case as their username, and their full name in the comment. Verify that the users and their home directory are properly created.</para>
	<screen>useradd -m -c "Serena Williams" serena ; passwd serena
useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd hunter2)-c "Venus Williams" venus
useradd -m -p $(./MyCrypt hunter2 42)-c "Justine Henin" justine
tail /etc/passwd ; tail /etc/shadow ; ls /home </screen>
	<para>2. Create a user called <command>kornuser</command>, give him the Korn shell (/bin/ksh) as his default shell. Log on with this user (on a command line or in a tty).</para>
	<screen>useradd -s /bin/ksh kornuser ; passwd kornuser</screen>
	<para>3. Create a user named <command>einstime</command> without home directory, give him <command>/bin/date</command> as his default logon shell. What happens when you log on with this user ? Can you think of a useful real world example for changing a user's login shell to an application ?</para>
	<screen>useradd -s /bin/date einstime ; passwd einstime</screen>
	<para>It can be useful when users need to access only one application on the server. Just logging on opens the application for them, and closing the application automatically logs them off.</para>
	<para>4. Try the commands who, whoami, who am i, w, id, echo $USER $UID .</para>
	<screen>who ; whoami ; who am i ; w ; id ; echo $USER $UID</screen>
	<para>5a. Lock the <command>venus</command> user account with usermod.</para>
	<screen>usermod -L venus</screen>
	<para>5b. Use <command>passwd -d</command> to disable the serena password. Verify the serena line in <command>/etc/shadow</command> before and after disabling.</para>
	<screen>grep serena /etc/shadow; passwd -d serena ; grep serena /etc/shadow</screen>
	<para>5c. What is the difference between locking a user account and disabling a user account's password ?</para>
	<para>Locking will prevent the user from logging on to the system with his password (by putting a ! in front of the password in /etc/shadow). Disabling with passwd will erase the password from /etc/shadow.</para>
	<para>6. As <command>root</command> change the password of <command>einstime</command> to stargate.</para>
	<screen>Log on as root and type: passwd einstime</screen>
	<para>7. Now try changing the password of serena to serena as serena.</para>
	<screen>log on as serena, then execute: passwd serena... it should fail!</screen>
	<para>8. Make sure every new user needs to change his password every 10 days.</para>
	<screen>For an existing user: chage -M 10 serena</screen>
	<screen>For all new users: vi /etc/login.defs (and change PASS_MAX_DAYS to 10)</screen>
	<para>9. Set the warning number of days to four for the kornuser.</para>
	<screen>chage -W 4 kornuser</screen>
	<para>10a. Set the password of two separate users to stargate. Look at the encrypted stargate's in /etc/shadow and explain.</para>
	<para>If you used passwd, then the salt will be different for the two encrypted passwords.</para>
	<para>10b. Take a backup as root of /etc/shadow. Use vi to copy an encrypted stargate to another user. Can this other user now log on with stargate as a password ?</para>
	<screen>Yes.</screen>
	<para>11. Put a file in the skeleton directory and check whether it is copied to user's home directory. When is the skeleton directory copied ?</para>
	<screen>When you create a user account with a new home directory.</screen>
	<para>12. Why use <command>vipw</command> instead of <command>vi</command> ? What could be the problem when using <command>vi</command> or <command>vim</command> ?</para>
	<screen><command>vipw</command> will give a warning when someone else is already using that file.</screen>
	<para>13. Use chsh to list all shells, and compare to cat /etc/shells. Change your login shell to the Korn shell, log out and back in. Now change back to bash.</para>
	<screen>On Red Hat Enterprise Linux: chsh -l
On Debian/Ubuntu: cat /etc/shells</screen>
	<para>14. Which useradd option allows you to name a home directory ?</para>
	<screen>-d</screen>
	<para>15. How can you see whether the password of user harry is locked or unlocked ? Give a solution with grep and a solution with passwd.</para>
	<screen>grep harry /etc/shadow</screen>
	<screen>passwd -S harry</screen>
